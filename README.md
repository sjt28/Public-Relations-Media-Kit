# Public Relations Media Kit

As a student in the Public Relations class at Calvin University, I worked in a team to create a press kit promoting a graphic novel written by one of the professors. In this repo are the final versions of the materials we created, including the following:
- A summary report
- A press release
- A fact sheet
- A digital postcard
- A 30-second audio-only PSA (both the script and the final audio file are here)
- An example social media content calendar for the client

I've also included a copy of my Resume.
